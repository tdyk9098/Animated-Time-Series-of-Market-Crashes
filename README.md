# Animated-Time-Series-of-Market-Crashes

# Abstract
This project is an application of data visualization and animation to dynamically compare the cumulative returns of financial assets during significant market crashes. From the peak of January 2022, the S&P 500 has lost just over 13% (as of 5/13/23). Historically, the S&P 500 has had many instances of corrections greater than -10%. However, it is quite common for the market to recover rather quickly. The COVID-19 crash in March 2020 had a rapid recovery within a year, as did the 2018 Crypto crash, the 2015 Crash, and the 2011 Crash. Three significant crashes took longer than one year to recover, those were the 1970s Oil crisis, the 2000 Dotcom crash, and the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. As over a year has gone by since January 2022, fears of a lengthy recovery and an incoming economic recession grow.

# Introduction
This project compared the cumulative weekly returns of the S&P 500 over the three significant crashes and compared it to the current performance since January 2022. Additionally, the project explores the relative performance of gold, oil, U.S. dollar, U.S. 10 Yr Yield, and U.S. 2 Yr Yield with the S&P 500 over the 2000 Dotcom crash, the 2007 Global Financial Crisis, and the current performance since January 2022.
